    "In this project we analyize the I-94 interstate highway traffic using exploratory data visualization. The dataset used was generated by John Hogue and can be gotten from [UCI Machine Learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume). At the end of this project, we would have been able to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94."
